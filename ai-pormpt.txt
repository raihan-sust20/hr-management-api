1. Authentication & Authorization

Should this endpoint require authentication? - yes
Any specific role/permission requirements? - no

2. What Can Be Updated?
Which fields are allowed to be updated?

Option A: Only check_in_time can be updated
Option B: date can be updated
Option C: employee_id can be updated
Option D: All fields (employee_id, date, check_in_time) can be updated
Option E: Combination of the above?

- Option A

3. Validation Rules for Updates
If fields can be updated:

Should the same business rules apply as POST? (business hours, retroactive limit, future date check, etc.)
If updating date, should we check for duplicate (employee_id, new_date) combination? - date cannot be updated
If updating employee_id, should we verify the new employee exists? - employee_id cannot be updated
If updating both employee_id and date, should we check uniqueness? - not of these are updatable

4. Partial vs Full Update

Should this be a partial update (PATCH-like behavior where only provided fields are updated)?
Or full update (all fields required)? - PATCH- like. ONly check_in_time can be updated

5. Business Rules

Can we update attendance for deleted employees? - no
Should there be a time limit on how old an attendance record can be before it becomes immutable? (e.g., can't edit attendance older than 30 days) - yes
Can we update attendance records multiple times, or should there be a limit? - no

6. Uniqueness Constraint Handling
The database has a unique constraint on (employee_id, date). If updating creates a conflict:

What error should be returned? - conflict error
Should we suggest using the upsert POST endpoint instead? - yes

7. Response Format

Return the updated attendance record? - yes
Same format as GET/POST responses (minimal attendance data)? - yes
Should it use ResponseUtil.success? - yes

8. Error Handling

What if attendance ID doesn't exist? - not found error
What if no fields are provided to update? - validation error. Min 1 field must be provided
What if the update violates business rules? - throw suitable errors

9. Swagger Documentation

Should I include comprehensive Swagger docs similar to other endpoints? - yes

10. Use Case Clarification
Why would someone use PUT vs POST (which already does upsert)?

Is this for correcting mistakes in existing records? - yes. Only for correcting check in time of particular date
Is this for administrative overrides?
Understanding the use case will help design the right validation rules.
