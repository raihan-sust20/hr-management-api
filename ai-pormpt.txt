Great! Let me gather the context I need for implementing the POST /employees endpoint:

## 🤔 Context Needed

### 1. **Validation Rules**
- **Name**: Min/max length? Any special character restrictions? - Min 2 char. No restrictions
on Max char.
- **Age**: Should we validate against hiring_date and date_of_birth consistency? - yes
- **Designation**: Free text or from a predefined list? - free text
- **Dates**: 
  - Should hiring_date be in the past only or can it be future? - past only
  - Should we validate that date_of_birth + age matches approximately? - yes
  - Should hiring_date be after date_of_birth + 18 years? - yes
- **Salary**: Min/max range? - no range
- **Photo**: 
  - Required or optional? - required
  - Max file size? (default 5MB in config) - 5MB
  - Allowed formats? (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP?) - JPEG only

### 2. **Business Logic**
- Should we auto-calculate age from date_of_birth or accept it as input? - auto calculate
- Any duplicate check? (e.g., same name + date_of_birth?) - no
- Should photo be automatically renamed/stored with employee ID or random name? - automatically renamed/stored with employee ID

### 3. **Response Format**
- Return full employee object including photo_path? - yes
- Should we return a full URL for photo or just the path? - full url path

### 4. **Module Structure**
Should I create the complete module structure:
- `employee.types.ts`
- `employee.validation.ts`
- `employee.repository.ts`
- `employee.service.ts`
- `employee.controller.ts`
- `employee.routes.ts`

Or just the minimum needed for POST endpoint? - complete module structure

### 5. **Authentication**
- Should this endpoint require authentication? - yes
- If yes, any role-based restrictions? (e.g., only HR can create employees?) - no

### 6. **Testing**
- Should I create unit and integration tests for this endpoint? - yes

The module name should be employee.

**Please provide your preferences, and I'll implement accordingly!**

Do you need any more context based on the answer?

If no more context is required, share your plan first. I need to review it.
