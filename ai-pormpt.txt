Photo URL Strategy: I notice in employee.service.ts that generatePhotoUrl() is commented out in the response. Should the single employee endpoint include the full photo URL, or follow the same pattern as the list endpoint (no photo URL)?
Response Format: Should this endpoint return:

Full details with photo URL (like IEmployeeResponseDto)? - full details but photo URL is commented out
in  IEmployeeResponseDto. It will not be added in response.
Minimal details (like IEmployeeListItemDto)? - no
Something else? - no


Error Handling: When employee is not found, should it return:

404 with standard error format? - yes
Any specific error message? - Something like: 'Employee not found'


Authorization: Should this endpoint:

Require authentication (like other endpoints)? - yes
Have any additional authorization logic (e.g., can only view own profile)? - no


Additional Data: Should the response include:

Just the employee record? - yes
Related data (attendance records, reports, etc.)? - no



What I'll Implement (assuming standard patterns):
Based on your existing code patterns, I'll implement:

Route in employee.route.ts with authentication
Controller method in employee.controller.ts
Service method in employee.service.ts
Repository method in employee.repository.ts (already exists as findByIdWithDetails)
Validation in employee.validation.ts (already exists as employeeId)
Swagger documentation for the endpoint
